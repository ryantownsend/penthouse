# This class provides an abstract for the router interface. Whilst any Proc
# could be used, it's safest for people to sub-class to ensure that any future
# interface changes are catered for.
#
# A router class's responsibility in Penthouse is to receive a Rack::Request
# object from the App instance and return an identifier for that tenant
#

      # @param request [Rack::Request] The request from the Rack app, used to determine the tenant
      # @return [String, Symbol] A tenant identifier
